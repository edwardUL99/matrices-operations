PROJECT TITLE: 2D Arrays and Matrices Operations
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Developed to implement matrices operations learned in mathematics into Java
VERSION or DATE:13-02-2019
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:Run "java Driver" in the terminal
AUTHORS: Edward Lynch-Milner

NOTE:

I have included a Lua version of SOME of the operations provided by the Matrices java class, just to show same can be done in a different language. Please note, however, you will need to have Lua installed on your system. It is a complicated process with many instructions available on https://medium.com/@CassiusBenard/lua-basics-windows-7-installation-and-running-lua-files-from-the-command-line-e8196e988d71 (Written for Windows 7 but worked on my Windows 10 PC
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

On a Windows PC, double click the Run.bat file but make sure you run it inside the directory
containing the java files or else errors will occur

---Step by Step if you want to know---
1.P.S. The Driver.java file included in this project is solely for the purpose of testing
every method provided by our Matrices class as often as possible to provide an increased
level of confidence in that the methods work correctly. You can add any commands as to your wishes
in the Driver.java file to test the methods. 

2.Open the command prompt, on Windows press CTRL + R and type cmd. (Shortcut below)

3.Type cd <Drive Letter>:\Dir1\Dir2 etc.

For example, say the files were located in a folder called assignment inside a directory
called Programming Assignment on a flash drive of drive G:, you would type:

	cd G:\Programming Assignment\assignment\

4.Type "javac Driver.java" without quotes, to ensure you have the latest class file possible.
Note that you will not need to compile the Matrices.java file separately if it is referenced
in the Driver.java file already

5.Finally enter "java Driver" and the program should execute

-----SHORTCUT----
1.Open Windows Explorer
2.Locate the directory and open it
3.Go to the navigation bar(i.e. where it shows the path)
4.Remove everything in the nav. bar and type cmd.exe and it should open a tutorial window
in the directory and run the above commands
